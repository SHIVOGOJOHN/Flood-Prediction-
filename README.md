# 1.FLOOD PREDICTION 
The purpose of this project is to employ machine learning models that Predict the likelihood of flooding in a particular area so that authorities and individuals are forewarned to prevent losses(human life and infrastructure) where possible.

# 2.Features of the dataset

# 3.Dataset To Analyse
[flood.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16319866/flood.csv)


# 4.Problem and models to employ
Since we are predicting continuous values models for regression problems will be used. That is : LinearRegression, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, MLPRegressor,
SVR(standard vector machine)

# 5.Dataset For the Prediction 
[flood.csv2 (1).csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16319878/flood.csv2.1.csv)

# Final dataset with predicted values
