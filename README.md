# 1.FLOOD PREDICTION 
The purpose of this project is to employ machine learning models that Predict the likelihood of flooding in a particular area so that authorities and individuals are forewarned and appropriate measures be taken to prevent losses.

# 2.Features of the dataset

# 3.Dataset (.csv file)
[flood.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16319866/flood.csv)


# 4.Machine learning models
Since we are predicting continuous values models for regression problems will be used. That is : LinearRegression, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, MLPRegressor,
SVR(standard vector machine)

# 5.Datset (cleaned)
